                <p className='text-white'>To help the business grow, Veaceslav participated in the 2021 grants competition announced by the “EU4Moldova: Focal Region” programme, funded by the EU and implemented by UNDP and UNICEF. As a result, he received approximately €25,000 for the purchase of various equipment installed in the restaurant, warehouse, bakery, and semi-finished products production point.

                    Currently, “Augusto” is endowed with high-performance equipment: electric ovens, fryers, refrigerated display cabinets, sinks, etc.

                    The popularity of the place is on the rise, thanks to the special Italian-style pizza-making technology. Augusto’s pizza dough is made using a unique technology and the cheese and filling are provided by local producers.
